|                                 | Beginner (i.e. passengers) | Intermediate (i.e. crew) | Advanced (i.e. pilots) |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Skill level                     | - Familiarity with Python and Linux / Mac OS<br> - Can run code with documentation and examples | - Experience (~1 year) with Python and containers<br> - Can run common MRI processing software | - Experience (>3 years) with Python, bash, and containers <br> - Routinely runs several MRI processing software with decent understanding of the underlying code |
| Reason to use                   | **Data**: Need to standardize organization of my own dataset(s) and establish data availability <br>**Proc**: Just want to do run a few common proc pipes in reproducible manner | **Data**: Need to manage multiple datasets to eventually perform mega- or meta-analysis <br>**Proc**: Need flexibility to modify and track pipeline versions, run-time args easily | **Data**: Need to manage multiple datasets possibly with decentralized data collection <br>**Proc**: Need to deploy custom pipelines and share them with the community |
| Challenges faced                | **Data**: How many subjects do I have matching my inclusion criteria for demographics, assessments, and imaging data? <br>**Proc**: How many subjects have I processed already with pipeline A and B? | **Data**: How do I inventorize multimodal data (imaging and non-imaging) captured with inconsistent naming across datasets? <br>**Proc**: How do I standardize and automate processing across datasets with provenance of runtime parameters? | **Data**: How do I simplify cross-dataset, cross-modality (imaging and non-imaging) data discovery in a distributed setup? <br>**Proc**: How do I share and deploy custom pipelines on multiple compute machines and track successful completion and provenance of runtime parameters? |
